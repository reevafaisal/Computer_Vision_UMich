# Computer_Vision_UMich
-	Built an image resizing program using a seam-carving algorithm.
-	Used Matrices and Images as Abstract Data Types (ADT) through structs.
The processing module contains several functions, some that provide an interface for content-aware resizing of images, while the others correspond to individual steps in the seam carving algorithm.
-	The main resize program supports content-aware resizing of images via a command line interface.
*Due to university policy code is not publicly available but can be sent upon request.
